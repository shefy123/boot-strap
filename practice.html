	<p style="font-weight:bold; color:orange;">I love going to school and I have always taken my studies very seriously. I have never said to anyone in my life, that 'I hate studies'. Many people find me as a geek, but I only see that as a compliment rather than an insult.<strong style="font-weight:italic; color:red;"> I have got big dreams, when it comes to studies.</strong> Since I was 6 years old, I decided to be a doctor. So that is my goal and I always try to aim to do my best at school, so hopefully my hard work will pay off in the end. I don't really know why I decided to be a doctor. I just love hospitals. Although I do feel very sorry whenever I see the poor patients in there, but just the fact that we have got hospitals to cure people is a great thing. Caring for people has always been my desire. Whenever I see someone, who I think need careness or help, I am always willing to help them.</p>
